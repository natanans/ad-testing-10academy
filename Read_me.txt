There were three objectives set up in this challenge. Each can be thought of a building block to the other. The first one was the classic A/b test wich is easy to understand and implement. In it, you compare a control condition to one where a treatment is applied, so you can then analyze if there is a significant difference between the respondents’ behavior in the treatment vs. the control baseline. A/B Testing can also be useful in web development and marketing because it allows you to compare two versions of a product or design in order to determine which performs better or is preferred by your customers. We can also increase the number of variables we are testing but it would become complex and loose its advantage.

The second one is a concept which tries to make the former much faster. Sequential A/b test tries to compute an upper and lower bound for each drawn sample instead of waiting for the whole data set to be consumed. This makes it faster but reduces its power as the whole provided information is not taken under consideration.

The final concept was Machine Learning and its use in A/B tests. Machine learning is a technique used to analyze large data sets. Gone are the days of pouring over expansive contact lists and target audiences — machine learning does that heavy lifting on a quicker, more accurate, and larger scale. data might not be conclusive when you need it, and you might find your audience is relatively evenly split, with a large group preferring the less-favored option.

Machine learning's powerful makeup can help with these issues by automating A/B testing. The algorithms of machine learning also enable marketers to analyze results more accurately.
